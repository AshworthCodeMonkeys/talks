The contents of this folder won't make much sense outside the context
of the talk, as we hacked on this code on-the-fly, but here's a brief summary:

find_common_kmers.py - A simple function taken from Martin's new bug. Deliberately buggy.

test_kmer.py - Some unit tests written during the session. As the file name starts test_ you can simply run these with ```python3 -munittest```

find_common_kmers2.py - A debugged version, to which we added some code to make it a standalone script

find_common_kmers2.py - A debugged version, with all code brought into functions to aid unit testing

pres.odt - The slides, in OpenOffice format
