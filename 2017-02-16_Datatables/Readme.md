Docs: www.datatables.net

Datatables is a Javascript/JQuery library for creating interactive HTML tables, useful for communicating large
amounts of textual data.

It's very easy to initialise a plain HTML table as a simple datatable. Adding a `<script>` element calling
the datatable constructor on the correct `<table>` element already gives you sorting, searching and
pagination.

Datatables has a Buttons extension allowing you to add extra functionality, e.g. showing/hiding columns,
copying to clipboard and exporting in PDF format. It's also possible to play around with how each column is
rendered, and even inject HTML into the table cells.

Datatables can also be configured to get their data from external data sources such as a Rest API. Pagination
can be done client-side (with one large Rest query returning unpaginated data) or server side (where the table
sends a request to the data source for the correct page of data).
