# Files for unit testing mini-workshop

The contents of this folder won't make much sense outside the context
of the talk, as we'll on this code on-the-fly, but here's a brief summary:

find_common_kmers.py - A simple function taken from Martin's new book. Deliberately buggy.

test_kmer.py - Some unit tests written during the session. As the file name starts test_ you can simply run these with ```python3 -munittest```

... more to come

pres.odt - The slides, in OpenOffice format
